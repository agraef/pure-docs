These are fairly complete Pure bindings for the OpenGL graphics library, which
allow you to do 2D and 3D graphics programming with Pure. The bindings should
work out of the box on most contemporary systems which have OpenGL drivers
installed, thanks to Scott's on-demand loading code for the GL functions,
which accounts for the fact that different GL implementations will export
different functions. (Mostly to account for Microsoft's Museum of Ancient
OpenGL History, otherwise known as opengl32.dll.)

Information about OpenGL can be found at: @indicateurl{http://www.opengl.org/}

As of pure-gl 0.5, the bindings are now generated using pure-gen instead of
Scott's original OpenGL-specific generator. The stuff needed to do this is
included (except pure-gen, which is a separate package available from the Pure
website), so that you can regenerate the bindings if necessary.

Get the latest source from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-gl-0.8.tar.gz}.

Normally you just run @code{make && sudo make install}, as with the other Pure
modules. (See The Makefile for further options.) This doesn't regenerate the
bindings and so can be done on any system which has Pure, OpenGL and a C
compiler installed.

If you miss some vendor-specific OpenGL functionality which is in your
system's header files but not in the distributed bindings, with some effort
you can fix that yourself by regenerating the bindings, see below.

The bindings mainly consist of 3 Pure files: GL.pure, GLU.pure and GLUT.pure.

In your Pure program, write something like:

@example
using GL, GLU, GLUT;
@end example

@noindent

GL.pure covers OpenGL up through version 2.1. To get access to extensions, you
include GL_XXX.pure where XXX is the extensions suffix. Currently, there are
GL_ARB.pure, GL_EXT.pure, GL_NV.pure and GL_ATI.pure, which should cover about
99% of the useful extensions out there. If you need more than that, it is
straightforward to tweak the Makefile to scrape some of the more esoteric
extensions from your headers. All OpenGL functions are loaded on first use. If
your OpenGL implementation does not define a given function, a
@code{gl_unsupported} exception is thrown with the name of the function as its
only argument.

The functions are in namespaces GL, GLU and GLUT respectively. Functions
are in curried form, i.e.:

@example
GL::Vertex3d 1.0 2.0 3.0;
@end example

@noindent

GL enumerants are in uppercase, as in C:

@example
GL::Begin GL::LINE_STRIP;
@end example

@noindent

Currently, if the GLU or GLUT bindings reference a function that your DLL does
not contain, it echoes this to stdout. I'm working on a way to supress this.

Some examples can be found in the examples subdirectory. This also includes a
wrapper of Rasterman's imlib2 library (also generated with pure-gen), and an
example which uses this to render an image as a texture.

The examples/flexi-line directory contains Eduardo Cavazos' port of the
flexi-line demo. Run @code{pure flexi-line-auto.pure}, sit back and enjoy. There's
also an interactive version of the demo available in flexi-line.pure.

@chapter Regenerating the Bindings


You need to have pure-gen installed to do this.

Also make sure that you have the OpenGL headers installed. By default, the
Makefile assumes that they are in the GL subdirectory of /usr/include, you can
set the @code{glpath} variable in the Makefile accordingly to change this. (Set
@code{glpath} to the path under which the GL subdirectory resides, not to the GL
subdirectory itself. See below for an example.) Note that on Linux systems,
/usr/include/GL usually contains the MESA headers. If available, you may want
to use your GPU vendor's headers instead, to get all the extensions available
on your system.

Alternatively, you can also just put the headers (gl.h, glext.h, glu.h,
glut.h, and any other OpenGL headers that get #included in those) into the GL
subdirectory of the pure-gl sources, by copying them over or creating symbolic
links to them. This is particularly useful for maintainers, who may want to
use a "staged" header set which is different from the installed OpenGL
headers. The "." directory will always be searched first, so you can also just
put the vendor-specific headers there. For instance, if you're like Scott and
you use Ubuntu with an Nvidia GPU, then you can do this:

@example
cd pure-gl/GL
ln -s /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx-new-dev/include/GL/gl.h
ln -s /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx-new-dev/include/GL/glext.h
@end example

@noindent

Finally, the Makefile also assumes that you have freeglut (an improved GLUT
replacement) installed and want all the extensions offered by freeglut. To use
the vanilla GLUT without the extensions instead, you only have to change the
value of the @code{source} variable in the Makefile from GL/all_gl_freeglut.h to
GL/all_gl.h. If you use openglut instead of freeglut you will have to change
the GL/all_gl_freeglut.h file accordingly.

Once you have set up things to your liking, you can regenerate the bindings by
running make as follows:

@example
make generate
@end example

@noindent

If you need a custom path to the OpenGL headers as described above (say,
/usr/local/include) then do this instead:

@example
make generate glpath=/usr/local/include
@end example

@noindent

If you're lucky, this will regenerate all the GL*.pure and GL*.c files, and
recompile the shared module from the GL*.c files after that. This shared
module, instead of the OpenGL libraries themselves, is what gets loaded by the
Pure modules.

If you're not so lucky, save a complete build log with all the error messages
and ask on the pure-lang mailing list for help.

See the "Generator stuff" section in the Makefile for further options. Adding
a rule for other extensions should be easy, just have a look at an existing
one (e.g., GL_EXT.c) and modify it accordingly.
