  Albert Graef <<aggraef@gmail.com>>

  This package contains software which makes it easier to use Faust DSPs
with Pd and the Pure programming language.  The main component is the
faust2pd script which creates GUI wrappers for Faust DSPs.  The package
also includes a bunch of examples.  The software is distributed under
the GPL; see the COPYING file for details.

     Note: This faust2pd version is written in Pure and was ported from
     an earlier version written in Pure’s predecessor Q. The version of
     the script provided here should be 100% backward-compatible to
     those previous versions, except for the following changes:

        - The (rarely used) -f (a.k.a.  –fake-buttons) option was
          renamed to -b.

        - A new -f (a.k.a.  –font-size) option was added to change the
          font size of the GUI elements.

        - Most command line options can now also be specified using
          special ‘[pd:...]’ tags in the Faust source.

     Also note that you can now run the script on 64 bit systems (Q
     never worked there).

  As of version 2.1, the faust2pd script is now compiled to a native
executable before installation.  This makes the program start up much
faster, which is a big advantage because most xml files don’t take long
to be processed.

2 Requirements
**************

faust2pd is known to work on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and there
shouldn’t be any major roadblocks preventing it to work on other systems
supported by Pure.

  The faust2pd script is written in the Pure(1) programming language and
requires Pure’s XML module, so you need to install these to make it
work.  Install the latest pure*.tar.gz and pure-xml*.tar.gz packages and
you should be set.  (Pure 0.47 or later is required.)  Also make sure
that the LLVM base package is installed, as described in the Pure
INSTALL file, some LLVM utilities are needed to make Pure’s batch
compiler work.

  To run the seqdemo example, you’ll also need the Pd Pure external
(pd-pure*.tar.gz), also available at the Pure(2) website.

  To compile the examples, you’ll need GNU C++ and make, Pd(3) and, of
course, Faust(4).  Make sure you get a recent version of Faust; Faust
releases >0.9.8 include the puredata architecture necessary to create Pd
externals from Faust DSPs.

File: faust2pd.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Quickstart,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Top

3 Installation
**************

Get the latest source from
‘https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/faust2pd-2.8.tar.gz’.

  Run ‘make’ and ‘make install’ to compile and install the faust2pd
program on your system.  You can set the installation prefix by running
make as ‘make install prefix=/some/path’.  Default installation prefix
is /usr/local, faust2pd is installed in the bin directory below that.

  Optionally, you can also run ‘make install-pd’ to copy the supporting
Pd abstractions (faust-*.pd) to your lib/pd/extra directory, so that you
can use the patches generated by faust2pd without copying these
abstractions to your working directory.  The Makefile tries to guess the
prefix of your Pd installation, if it guesses wrong, you can specify the
prefix explicitly by running make as ‘make install-pd
pdprefix=/some/path’.

  The included faustxml.pure script provides access to Faust-generated
dsp descriptions in xml files to Pure scripts.  This module is described
in its own *note appendix: 7. below.  It may have uses beyond faust2pd,
but isn’t normally installed.  If you want to use this module, you can
just copy it to your Pure library directory.

4 Quickstart
************

Run ‘make examples’ to compile the Faust examples included in this
package to corresponding Pd plugins.  After that you should be able to
run the patches in the various subdirectories of the examples directory.
Everything is set up so that you can try the examples "in-place",
without installing anything except the required software as noted in
*note Requirements: 4. above.  You can also run ‘make realclean’ before
‘make’ to regenerate everything from scratch (this requires faust2pd, so
this will only work if you already installed the Pure interpreter).

  Faust Pd plugins work in much the same way as the well-known plugin~
object (which interfaces to LADSPA plugins), except that each Faust DSP
is compiled to its own Pd external.  Under Linux, the basic compilation
process is as follows (taking the freeverb module from the Faust
distribution as an example):

     # compile the Faust source to a C++ module using the "puredata" architecture
     faust -a puredata.cpp freeverb.dsp -o freeverb.cpp
     # compile the C++ module to a Pd plugin
     g++ -shared -Dmydsp=freeverb freeverb.cpp -o freeverb~.pd_linux

  By these means, a Faust DSP named ‘xyz’ with n audio inputs and m
audio outputs becomes a Pd object ‘xyz~’ with n+1 inlets and m+1
outlets.  The leftmost inlet/outlet pair is for control messages only.
This allows you to inspect and change the controls the unit provides, as
detailed below.  The remaining inlets and outlets are the audio inputs
and outputs of the unit, respectively.  For instance, ‘freeverb.dsp’
becomes the Pd object ‘freeverb~’ which, in addition to the control
inlet/outlet pair, has 2 audio inputs and outputs.

  When creating a Faust object it is also possible to specify, as
optional creation parameters, an extra unit name (this is explained in
the following section) and a sample rate.  If no sample rate is
specified explicitly, it defaults to the sample rate at which Pd is
executing.  (Usually it is not necessary or even desirable to override
the default choice, but this might occasionally be useful for debugging
purposes.)

  As already mentioned, the main ingredient of this package is a Pure
script named "faust2pd" which allows you to create Pd abstractions as
"wrappers" around Faust units.  The wrappers generated by faust2pd can
be used in Pd patches just like any other Pd objects.  They are much
easier to operate than the "naked" Faust plugins themselves, as they
also provide "graph-on-parent" GUI elements to inspect and change the
control values.

  The process to compile a plugin and build a wrapper patch is very
similar to what we’ve seen above.  You only have to add the -xml option
when invoking the Faust compiler and run faust2pd on the resulting XML
file:

     # compile the Faust source and generate the xml file
     faust -a puredata.cpp -xml freeverb.dsp -o freeverb.cpp
     # compile the C++ module to a Pd plugin
     g++ -shared -Dmydsp=freeverb freeverb.cpp -o freeverb~.pd_linux
     # generate the Pd patch from the xml file
     faust2pd freeverb.dsp.xml

  Please see *note Wrapping DSPs with faust2pd: a. below for further
details.

  Note that, just as with other Pd externals and abstractions, the
compiled .pd_linux modules and wrapper patches must be put somewhere
where Pd can find them.  To these ends you can either move the files
into the directory with the patches that use the plugin, or you can put
them into the lib/pd/extra directory or some other directory on Pd’s
library path for system-wide use.

  Also, faust2pd-generated wrappers use a number of supporting
abstractions (the faust-*.pd files in the faust2pd sources), so you have
to put these into the directory of the main patch or install them under
lib/pd/extra as well.  (The ‘make pd-install’ step does the latter, see
*note Installation: 5. above.)


File: faust2pd.info,  Node: Control Interface,  Next: Examples,  Prev: Quickstart,  Up: Top

5 Control Interface
*******************

The control inlet of a Faust plugin understands messages in one of the
following forms:

   - ‘bang’, which reports all available controls of the unit on the
     control outlet, in the form: ‘type name val init min max step’,
     where ‘type’ is the type of the control as specified in the Faust
     source (‘checkbox’, ‘nentry’, etc.), ‘name’ its (fully qualified)
     name, ‘val’ the current value, and ‘init’, ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘step’ the
     initial value, minimum, maximum and stepsize of the control,
     respectively.

   - ‘foo 0.99’, which sets the control ‘foo’ to the value 0.99, and
     outputs nothing.

   - Just ‘foo’, which outputs the (fully qualified) name and current
     value of the ‘foo’ control on the control outlet.

  Control names can be specified in their fully qualified form, like
e.g.  ‘/gnu/bar/foo’ which indicates the control ‘foo’ in the subgroup
‘bar’ of the topmost group ‘gnu’, following the hierarchical group
layout defined in the Faust source.  This lets you distinguish between
different controls with the same name which are located in different
groups.  To find out about all the controls of a unit and their fully
qualified names, you can bang the control inlet of the unit as described
above, and connect its control outlet to a ‘print’ object, which will
cause the descriptions of all controls to be printed in Pd’s main
window.  (The same information can also be used, e.g., to initialize GUI
elements with the proper values.  Patches generated with faust2pd rely
on this.)

  You can also specify just a part of the control path (like ‘bar/foo’
or just ‘foo’ in the example above) which means that the message applies
to _all_ controls which have the given pathname as the final portion of
their fully qualified name.  Thus, if there is more than one ‘foo’
control in different groups of the Faust unit then sending the message
‘foo’ to the control inlet will report the fully qualified name and
value for each of them.  Likewise, sending ‘foo 0.99’ will set the value
of all controls named ‘foo’ at once.

  Concerning the naming of Faust controls in Pd you should also note the
following:

   - A unit name can be specified at object creation time, in which case
     the given symbol is used as a prefix for all control names of the
     unit.  E.g., the control ‘/gnu/bar/foo’ of an object ‘baz~’ created
     with ‘baz~ baz1’ has the fully qualified name ‘/baz1/gnu/bar/foo’.
     This lets you distinguish different instances of an object such as,
     e.g., different voices of a polyphonic synth unit.

   - Pd’s input syntax for symbols is rather restrictive.  Therefore
     group and control names in the Faust source are mangled into a form
     which only contains alphanumeric characters and hyphens, so that
     the control names are always legal Pd symbols.  For instance, a
     Faust control name like ‘meter #1 (dB)’ will become ‘meter-1-dB’
     which can be input directly as a symbol in Pd without any problems.

   - "Anonymous" groups and controls (groups and controls which have
     empty labels in the Faust source) are omitted from the path
     specification.  E.g., if ‘foo’ is a control located in a main group
     with an empty name then the fully qualified name of the control is
     just ‘/foo’ rather than ‘//foo’.  Likewise, an anonymous control in
     the group ‘/foo/bar’ is named just ‘/foo/bar’ instead of
     ‘/foo/bar/’.

  Last but not least, there is also a special control named ‘active’
which is generated automatically for your convenience.  The default
behaviour of this control is as follows:

   - When ‘active’ is nonzero (the default), the unit works as usual.

   - When ‘active’ is zero, and the unit’s number of audio inputs and
     outputs match, then the audio input is simply passed through.

   - When ‘active’ is zero, but the unit’s number of audio inputs and
     outputs do _not_ match, then the unit generates silence.

  The ‘active’ control frequently alleviates the need for special
"bypass" or "mute" controls in the Faust source.  However, if the
default behaviour of the generated control is not appropriate you can
also define your own custom version of ‘active’ explicitly in the Faust
program; in this case the custom version will override the default one.

6 Examples
**********

In the examples subdirectory you’ll find a bunch of sample Faust DSPs
and Pd patches illustrating how Faust units are used in Pd.

   - The examples/basic/test.pd patch demonstrates the basics of
     operating "bare" Faust plugins in Pd.  You’ll rarely have to do
     this when using the wrappers generated with the faust2pd program,
     but it is a useful starting point to take a look behind the scenes
     anyway.

   - The examples/faust directory contains all the examples from (an
     earlier version of) the Faust distribution, along with
     corresponding Pd wrappers generated with faust2pd.  Have a look at
     examples/faust/faustdemo.pd to see some of the DSPs in action.
     Note that not all examples from the Faust distribution are working
     out of the box because of name clashes with Pd builtins, so we
     renamed those.  We also edited some of the .dsp sources (e.g.,
     turning buttons into checkboxes or sliders into nentries) where
     this seemed necessary to make it easier to operate the Pd patches.

   - The examples/synth directory contains various plugins and patches
     showing how to implement polyphonic synthesizers using Faust units.
     Take a look at examples/synth/synth.pd for an example.  If you have
     properly configured your interfaces then you should be able to play
     the synthesizer via Pd’s MIDI input.

   - The examples/seqdemo/seqdemo.pd patch demonstrates how to operate a
     multitimbral synth, built with Faust units, in an automatic fashion
     using a pattern sequencer programmed in Pure.  This example
     requires the Pure interpreter as well as the pd-pure plugin
     available from ‘http://purelang.bitbucket.org’.

7 Wrapping DSPs with faust2pd
*****************************

The faust2pd script generates Pd patches from the dsp.xml files created
by Faust when run with the -xml option.  Most of the sample patches were
actually created that way.  After installation you can run the script as
follows:

     faust2pd [-hVbs] [-f size] [-o output-file] [-n #voices]
       [-r max] [-X patterns] [-x width] [-y height] input-file

  The default output filename is ‘input-file’ with new extension ‘.pd’.
Thus, ‘faust2pd filename.dsp.xml’ creates a Pd patch named ‘filename.pd’
from the Faust XML description in ‘filename.dsp.xml’.

  The faust2pd program understands a number of options which affect the
layout of the GUI elements and the contents of the generated patch.
Here is a brief list of the available options:

‘-h’
‘--help’

     display a short help message and exit

‘-V’
‘--version’

     display the version number and exit

‘-b’
‘--fake-buttons’

     replace buttons (bangs) with checkboxes (toggles)

‘-f’
‘--font-size’

     font size for GUI elements (10 by default)

‘-n’
‘--nvoices’

     create a synth patch with the given number of voices

‘-o’
‘--output-file’

     output file name (.pd file)

‘-r’
‘--radio-sliders’

     radio controls for sliders

‘-s’
‘--slider-nums’

     sliders with additional number control

‘-X’
‘--exclude’

     exclude controls matching the given glob patterns

‘-x’
‘--width’

     maximum width of the GUI area

‘-y’
‘--height’

     maximum height of the GUI area

  Just like the Faust plugin itself, the generated patch has a control
input/output as the leftmost inlet/outlet pair, and the remaining plugs
are signal inlets and outlets for each audio input/output of the Faust
unit.  However, the control inlet/outlet pair works slightly different
from that of the Faust plugin.  Instead of being used for control
replies, the control outlet of the patch simply passes through its
control input (after processing messages which are understood by the
wrapped plugin).  By these means control messages can flow along with
the audio signal through an entire chain of Faust units.  (You can find
an example of this in examples/faust/faustdemo.pd.)  Moreover, when
generating a polyphonic synth patch using the -n option then there will
actually be two control inlets, one for note messages and one for
ordinary control messages; this is illustrated in the
examples/synth/synth.pd example.

  The generated patch also includes the necessary GUI elements to see
and change all (active and passive) controls of the Faust unit.  Faust
control elements are mapped to Pd GUI elements in an obvious fashion,
following the horizontal and vertical layout specified in the Faust
source.  The script also adds special buttons for resetting all controls
to their defaults and to operate the special ‘active’ control.

  This generally works very well, but you should be aware that the
control GUIs generated by faust2pd are somewhat hampered by the limited
range of GUI elements available in a vanilla Pd installation.  As a
remedy, faust2pd provides various options to change the content of the
generated wrapper and work around these limitations.

   - There are no real button widgets as required by the Faust
     specification, so bangs are used instead.  There is a global delay
     time for switching the control from 1 back to 0, which can be
     changed by sending a value in milliseconds to the ‘faust-delay’
     receiver.  If you need interactive control over the switching time
     then it is better to use checkboxes instead, or you can have
     faust2pd automatically substitute checkboxes for all buttons in a
     patch by invoking it with the -b a.k.a.  –fake-buttons option.

   - Sliders in Pd do not display their value in numeric form so it may
     be hard to figure out what the current value is.  Therefore
     faust2pd has an option -s a.k.a.  –slider-nums which causes it to
     add a number box to each slider control.  (This flag also applies
     to Faust’s passive bargraph controls, as these are implemented
     using sliders, see below.)

   - Pd’s sliders also have no provision for specifying a stepsize, so
     they are an awkward way to input integral values from a small
     range.  OTOH, Faust doesn’t support the "radio" control elements
     which Pd provides for that purpose.  As a remedy, faust2pd allows
     you to specify the option -r max (a.k.a.  –radio-sliders=max) to
     indicate that sliders with integral values from the range 0..max-1
     are to be mapped to corresponding Pd radio controls.

   - Faust’s bargraphs are emulated using sliders.  Note that these are
     passive controls which just display a value computed by the Faust
     unit.  A different background color is used for these widgets so
     that you can distinguish them from the ordinary (active) slider
     controls.  The values shown in passive controls are sampled every
     40 ms by default.  You can change this value by sending an
     appropriate message to the global ‘faust-timer’ receiver.

   - Since Pd has no "tabbed" (notebook-like) GUI element, Faust’s
     tgroups are mapped to hgroups instead.  It may be difficult to
     present large and complicated control interfaces without tabbed
     dialogs, though.  As a remedy, you can control the amount of
     horizontal or vertical space available for the GUI area with the -x
     and -y (a.k.a.  –width and –height) options and faust2pd will then
     try to break rows and columns in the layout to make everything fit
     within that area.  (This feature has only been tested with simple
     layouts so far, so beware.)

   - You can also exclude certain controls from appearing in the GUI
     using the -X option.  This option takes a comma-separated list of
     shell glob patterns indicating either just the names or the fully
     qualified paths of Faust controls which are to be excluded from the
     GUI. For instance, the option ‘-X
     'volume,meter*,faust/resonator?/*'’ will exclude all volume
     controls, all controls whose names start with ‘meter’, and all
     controls in groups matching ‘faust/resonator?’.  (Note that the
     argument to -X has to be quoted if it contains any wildcards such
     as ‘*’ and ‘?’, so that the shell doesn’t try to expand the
     patterns beforehand.  Also note that only one -X option is
     recognized, so you have to specify all controls to be excluded as a
     single option.)

   - Faust group labels are not shown at all, since I haven’t found an
     easy way to draw some kind of labelled frame in Pd yet.

  Despite these limitations, faust2pd appears to work rather well, at
least for the kind of DSPs found in the Faust distribution.  (Still, for
more complicated control surfaces and interfaces to be used on stage
you’ll probably have to edit the generated GUI layouts by hand.)

  For convenience, all the content-related command line options
mentioned above can also be specified in the Faust source, as special
tags in the label of the toplevel group of the dsp.  These take the form
‘[pd:option]’ or ‘[pd:option=value]’ where ‘option’ is any of the (long)
options understood by faust2pd.  For instance:

     process = vgroup("mysynth [pd:nvoices=8] [pd:slider-nums]", ...);

  Source options carrying arguments, like ‘nvoices’ in the above
example, can also be overridden with corresponding command line options.

8 Conclusion
************

Creating Faust plugins for use with Pd has never been easier before, so
I hope that you’ll soon have much joy trying your Faust programs in Pd.
Add Pd-Pure to this, and you can program all your specialized audio and
control objects using two modern-style functional languages which are
much more fun than C/C++.  Of course there’s an initial learning curve
to be mastered, but IMHO it is well worth the effort.  The bottomline is
that Pd+Faust+Pure really makes an excellent combo which provides you
with a powerful, programmable interactive environment for creating
advanced computer music and multimedia applications with ease.

9 Appendix: faustxml
********************

The faustxml module is provided along with faust2pd to retrieve the
description of a Faust DSP from its XML file as a data structure which
is ready to be processed by Pure programs.  It may also be useful in
other Pure applications which need to inspect descriptions of Faust
DSPs.

  The main entry point is the *note info: f. function which takes the
name of a Faust-generated XML file as argument and returns a tuple
‘(name, descr, version, in, out, controls)’ with the name, description,
version, number of inputs and outputs and the toplevel group with the
descriptions of the controls of the dsp.  A couple of other convenience
functions are provided to deal with the control descriptions.

9.2 Data Structure
==================

The following constructors are used to represent the UI controls of
Faust DSPs:

 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::button label
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::checkbox label

     A button or checkbox with the given label.

 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::nentry (label,init,min,max,step)
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::vslider (label,init,min,max,step)
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::hslider (label,init,min,max,step)

     A numeric input control with the given label, initial value, range
     and stepwidth.

 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::vbargraph (label,min,max)
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::hbargraph (label,min,max)

     A numeric output control with the given label and range.

 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::vgroup (label,controls)
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::hgroup (label,controls)
 -- Pure Constructor: faustxml::tgroup (label,controls)

     A group with the given label and list of controls in the group.


File: faust2pd.info,  Node: Operations,  Prev: Data Structure,  Up: Appendix faustxml

9.3 Operations
==============

 -- Pure Function: faustxml::controlp x

     Check for control description values.

 -- Pure Function: faustxml::control_type x
 -- Pure Function: faustxml::control_label x
 -- Pure Function: faustxml::control_args x

     Access functions for the various components of a control
     description.

 -- Pure Function: faustxml::controls x

     This function returns a flat representation of a control group ‘x’
     as a list of basic control descriptions, which provides a quick way
     to access all the control values of a Faust DSP. The grouping
     controls themselves are omitted.  You can pass the last component
     of the return value of the *note info: f. function to this
     function.

 -- Pure Function: faustxml::pcontrols x

     Works like the *note controls: 21. function above, but also
     replaces the label of each basic control with a fully qualified
     path consisting of all control labels leading up to the given
     control.  Thus, e.g., the label of a slider ‘"gain"’ inside a group
     ‘"voice#0"’ inside the main ‘"faust"’ group will be denoted by the
     label ‘"faust/voice#0/gain"’.

 -- Pure Function: faustxml::info fname

     Extract the description of a Faust DSP from its XML file.  This is
     the main entry point.  Returns a tuple with the name, description
     and version of the DSP, as well as the number of inputs and outputs
     and the toplevel group with all the control descriptions.  Raises
     an exception if the XML file doesn’t exist or contains invalid
     contents.

  Example:

     > using faustxml;
     > let name,descr,version,in,out,group =
     >   faustxml::info "examples/basic/freeverb.dsp.xml";
     > name,descr,version,in,out;
     "freeverb","freeverb -- a Schroeder reverb","1.0",2,2
     > using system;
     > do (puts.str) $ faustxml::pcontrols group;
     faustxml::hslider ("freeverb/damp",0.5,0.0,1.0,0.025)
     faustxml::hslider ("freeverb/roomsize",0.5,0.0,1.0,0.025)
     faustxml::hslider ("freeverb/wet",0.3333,0.0,1.0,0.025)
