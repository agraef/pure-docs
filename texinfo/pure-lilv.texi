@chapter Installation


Get the latest source from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-lilv-0.5.tar.gz}.

Run @code{make} to compile the module and @code{sudo make install} to install it in
the Pure library directory. To uninstall the module, use @code{sudo make
uninstall}. There are a number of other targets (mostly for maintainers),
please see the Makefile for details.

@code{make} tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually. In
particular, @code{make install prefix=/usr} sets the installation prefix.

@chapter Description


This package provides a Pure module for David Robillard's Lilv@footnote{http://drobilla.net/software/lilv/}, a library for
LV2 plugin host writers. LV2@footnote{http://lv2plug.in/} is the new Linux audio plugin standard (LADSPA
successor) which aims to be portable and extensible. Lilv makes it possible to
load LV2 plugins in audio and other multimedia software. It is provided as a
comprehensive and well-tested reference implementation for LV2 plugin hosts,
so that authors of multimedia software don't have to craft their own (and
often incomplete or bug-ridden) implementations of the LV2 plugin API.

This module is still under development, but we already offer operations to
retrieve information about the LV2 plugins installed on a system, and to
instantiate and run most basic plugins. Support for MIDI input and output and
handling LV2 presets and plugin state is also available. More work is still
needed in order to support more exotic event types such as transport state and
tempo changes, and any other extensions which may be required to run more
advanced plugins. We're still trying to figure these out, so if you notice
anything that's missing in the current implementation then please submit a
feature request.

Documentation still needs to be written. For the time being, please refer to
the lilv.pure script for a description of the programming interface, and to
the scripts in the examples folder for examples showing how to use the
operations provided by this module. Specifically, have a look at the
lilv_examp.pure script which illustrates most the API functions and how they
are used in a Pure script. There's also a fairly complete software synthesizer
example, synth.pure, which shows how to run instrument and effect plugins in a
synth/effects chain in order to synthesize audio from MIDI input. Another
complete example is the lv2plugin~ host for Pd which is written entirely in
Pure; you can find this at @indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-lv2plugin}.

Here's a brief excerpt from lilv_examp.pure which shows the necessary steps
involved in running an LV2 audio plugin with Pure:

@example
// Import the module.
using lilv;
// Load the LV2 world state.
let world = lilv::world;

// Instantiate a plugin.
let p = lilv::plugin world "http://faust-lv2.googlecode.com/amp" 44100 64;

// Get some information about the plugin (number of audio inputs and
// outputs, port descriptions).
let n,m = lilv::num_audio_inputs p, lilv::num_audio_outputs p;
let ports = [i, lilv::port_info p i | i = 0..lilv::num_ports p-1];

// Create some audio buffers for input and output.
let in = dmatrix @{0,1,0,-1,0,1,-1,0;0,1,0,-1,0,1,-1,0@};
let out = dmatrix (2,8);

// Activate the plugin.
lilv::activate p;

// Run some samples through the plugin.
lilv::run p in out;

// Set a control value.
lilv::set_control p 2 10;
// Compute some more samples.
lilv::run p in out;
// Get the values of some output controls.
map (lilv::get_control p) [4,5];

// Send a MIDI message.
lilv::set_midi p 10 [@{0xb0, 7, 127@}];
// Compute some more samples.
lilv::run p in out;
@end example
