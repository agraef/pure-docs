  This is a simple interface to Avahi(1), a Zeroconf(2) implementation
for Linux and other Un*x systems.  The module lets you publish and query
Zeroconf network services using Avahi, allowing you to establish
connections for various kinds of TCP and UDP network services without
having to manually configure network addresses.  It is typically used
along with the ‘sockets’ module which lets you create the network
connections discovered with *note avahi: 0.

  To keep things simple and easy to use, the module only exposes the
most essential functionality of Ahavi right now, but the provided
functions should hopefully be sufficient for most programs which require
interoperability with other Avahi or Apple Bonjour applications.  One
known limitation is that the module allows you to publish and discover
services in the default Avahi domain only.  Typically this is the
‘local’ domain, limiting you to services in the local network.  However,
this should cover most common uses of Zeroconf.

  There’s a companion ‘bonjour’ module which implements the same API for
Bonjour(3), Apple’s Zeroconf implementation.  Since both modules
implement the same functions, albeit in different namespaces, they can
be used as drop-in replacements for each other.  We also offer a
compatibility module named ‘zeroconf’ which can be used with either
pure-avahi or pure-bonjour in a transparent fashion, so that no source
changes are needed when switching the underlying implementation; please
check the zeroconf.pure script included in the sources for details.

  This module is in its early stages, so it may still contain bugs or
lack some features.  Please report bugs on the issue tracker at the Pure
Bitbucket site, and use the Pure mailing list for general discussion of
the module.

2 Installation
**************

Get the latest source from
‘https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-avahi-0.4.tar.gz’.

  Run ‘make’ to compile the module and ‘make install’ (as root) to
install it in the Pure library directory.  This requires GNU make, and
of course you need to have Pure and Avahi installed.  The latter should
be readily available on most Linux systems, and ports are available for
BSD systems as well.

  ‘make’ tries to guess your Pure installation directory and
platform-specific setup.  If it gets this wrong, you can set some
variables manually, please check the Makefile for details.

  Please note that the zeroconf.pure compatibility module is not
installed by default, so you may want to copy it to the Pure library
directory if needed.

3 Usage
*******

To use the operations of this module, you need to have Avahi installed
and the Avahi daemon running on your system.  The details of this depend
on the particular system that you use, so please consult the
documentation of your Linux or BSD distribution for instructions.

  The following import declaration loads the functions of the avahi
module in your Pure script:

     using avahi;


  All operations are in the ‘avahi’ namespace, so you might want to add
the following declaration to access the functions using their
unqualified identifiers:

     using namespace avahi;

4 Publishing Services
*********************

These functions allow you to advertise a network service using Avahi, so
that the service can be discovered by other applications participating
in the Zeroconf protocol.  Each service has a name (a string which
uniquely identifies the service), a type (indicating the application and
transport protocols utilized by the service) and a port number (TCP or
UDP port number, depending on the service type).  The service type
normally takes the form ‘_app._tcp’ (for TCP services) or ‘_app._udp’
(for UDP), where ‘_app’ specifies the protocol of the particular
application (such as ‘_ipp’ for network-connected printers, or ‘_osc’
for applications speaking the OSC a.k.a.  Open Sound Control protocol).

 -- Pure Function: avahi::publish name stype port

     Advertise a service in the local domain, given by its name (a
     string), service type (a string) and (TCP or UDP) port number (an
     integer).  Note that this operation is actually carried out
     asynchronously.  Use *note avahi;;check: 8. below to wait for and
     report the result of the operation.  The returned result is a
     pointer to the service object which can be passed to the following
     operations, or ‘NULL’ in case of error.  (A ‘NULL’ pointer can be
     passed safely to *note avahi;;check: 8.; it will fail in this
     case.)  The service will be unpublished automatically when the
     service object is garbage-collected.

 -- Pure Function: avahi::check service

     Check for the result of a *note avahi;;publish: 7. operation.  This
     blocks until a result is available.  A negative integer value
     indicates failure (in this case the result is the Avahi error
     code).  Otherwise the result is a triple with the actual service
     name, type and port.  Note that the name may be different from the
     one passed to *note avahi;;publish: 7. if there was a name
     collision with another service.  Such collisions are resolved
     automatically by tacking on a suffix of the form ‘#n’ to the
     service name.

5 Discovering Services
**********************

These functions let you discover services of a given service type.  For
each (resolvable) service you’ll be able to retrieve the corresponding
network address and port, which is what you’ll need to actually open a
network connection to communicate with the service.

 -- Pure Function: avahi::browse stype

     Browse available services of a given type in the local domain.
     This operation is carried out asynchronously; use *note
     avahi;;avail: b. below to check whether new information is
     available, and *note avahi;;get: c. to retrieve the actual service
     list.  The result returned by *note avahi;;browse: a. is a pointer
     to the browser object which can be passed to the following
     operations, or ‘NULL’ in case of error.  (A ‘NULL’ pointer can be
     passed safely to the other operations; they will fail in this
     case.)  Any resources allocated to the browser will be released
     automatically when the browser object is garbage-collected.

 -- Pure Function: avahi::avail browser

     Check whether the service information was updated since the last
     invocation of *note avahi;;get: c.  Returns an integer (truth
     value), which may also be negative (indicating the Avahi error
     code) in case of error.

 -- Pure Function: avahi::get browser

     Retrieve the current list of services.  Each list entry is a tuple
     with the name, type, domain, IP address (all string values) and
     port number (an integer) of a service.  The entries are in the same
     order as returned by Avahi, but only include services whose network
     addresses can actually be resolved using Avahi.  Note that this
     information may change over time, as new services are announced on
     the network or removed from it.  An application will typically call
     *note avahi;;avail: b. from time to time to check whether new
     information is available and then retrieve the updated service list
     using *note avahi;;get: c.  The result may also be a negative
     integer (indicating the Avahi error code) in case of error.

6 Example
*********

Here’s an example showing how to publish an UDP OSC (Open Sound Control)
service which might be used to connect to mobile OSC applications such
as hexler’s TouchOSC:

     using avahi;
     using namespace avahi;

     let s = publish "OSC Server" "_osc._udp" 8000;
     check s;


  The last line checks for the result of the operation and returns the
actual service name, type and port number if all went well.  A TouchOSC
instance running on the local network will then offer you to connect to
the service.

  Continuing the example, here’s how you can obtain a list of OSC
services currently available on your local network:

     let t = browse "_osc._udp";
     avail t;
     get t;


  If you’re running TouchOSC somewhere on your local network, it will be
listed there, along with our own service which we published above.  The
call in the second line can be used to check whether any new information
is available.  Applications typically invoke these two from time to time
to update their service list, using code like the following:

     avail t && get t;
