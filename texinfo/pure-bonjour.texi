@geindex bonjour (module)

Version 0.1, January 13, 2018

Albert Gräf <@email{aggraef@@gmail.com}>

This is a simple interface to Bonjour@footnote{http://developer.apple.com/bonjour/}, Apple's Zeroconf@footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking} implementation. The
module lets you publish and query Zeroconf network services using Bonjour,
allowing you to establish connections for various kinds of TCP and UDP network
services without having to manually configure network addresses. It is
typically used along with the @code{sockets} module which lets you create the
network connections discovered with @pxref{0,,bonjour}.

To keep things simple and easy to use, the module only exposes the most
essential functionality of Bonjour right now, but the provided functions
should hopefully be sufficient for most programs which require
interoperability with other Zeroconf applications. One known limitation is
that the module allows you to publish and discover services in the default
Bonjour domain only. Typically this is the @code{local} domain, limiting you to
services in the local network.  However, this should cover most common uses of
Zeroconf.

There's a companion @code{avahi} module which implements the same API for
Avahi@footnote{http://avahi.org/}, the prevalent Zeroconf implementation on Linux systems. Since both
modules implement the same functions, albeit in different namespaces, they can
be used as drop-in replacements for each other. We also offer a compatibility
module named @code{zeroconf} which can be used with either pure-avahi or
pure-bonjour in a transparent fashion, so that no source changes are needed
when switching the underlying implementation; please check the zeroconf.pure
script included in the sources for details.

This module is in its early stages, so it may still contain bugs or lack some
features. Please report bugs on the issue tracker at the Pure Bitbucket site,
and use the Pure mailing list for general discussion of the module.

@chapter Installation


Get the latest source from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-bonjour-0.1.tar.gz}.

Run @code{make} to compile the module and @code{make install} (as root) to install
it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make, and of course you
need to have Pure and Bonjour installed. The latter should be readily available
on most Linux systems, and ports are available for BSD systems as well.

@code{make} tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually, please
check the Makefile for details.

Please note that the zeroconf.pure compatibility module is not installed by
default, so you may want to copy it to the Pure library directory if needed.

@chapter Usage


To use the operations of this module, you need to have Bonjour (or a
compatible Zeroconf implementation such as Avahi) installed and the
corresponding service running on your system. If you have a Mac running OS X,
then most likely Bonjour is already up and running, but for other systems
you'll have to consult your system documentation for instructions.

The following import declaration loads the functions of the bonjour module in
your Pure script:

@example
using bonjour;
@end example

@noindent

All operations are in the @code{bonjour} namespace, so you might want to add the
following declaration to access the functions using their unqualified
identifiers:

@example
using namespace bonjour;
@end example

@noindent

@node Publishing Services,Discovering Services,Usage,Top
@anchor{pure-bonjour publishing-services}@anchor{6}
@chapter Publishing Services


These functions allow you to advertise a network service using Bonjour, so that
the service can be discovered by other applications participating in the
Zeroconf protocol. Each service has a name (a string which uniquely identifies
the service), a type (indicating the application and transport protocols
utilized by the service) and a port number (TCP or UDP port number, depending
on the service type). The service type normally takes the form @code{_app._tcp}
(for TCP services) or @code{_app._udp} (for UDP), where @code{_app} specifies the
protocol of the particular application (such as @code{_ipp} for network-connected
printers, or @code{_osc} for applications speaking the OSC a.k.a. Open Sound
Control protocol).

@geindex bonjour;;publish (function)
@anchor{pure-bonjour bonjour publish}@anchor{7}
@deffn {Pure Function} bonjour::publish name stype port

Advertise a service in the local domain, given by its name (a string),
service type (a string) and (TCP or UDP) port number (an integer). Note
that this operation is actually carried out asynchronously. Use
@pxref{8,,bonjour;;check} below to wait for and report the result of the
operation. The returned result is a pointer to the service object which can
be passed to the following operations, or @code{NULL} in case of error. (A
@code{NULL} pointer can be passed safely to @pxref{8,,bonjour;;check}; it will fail
in this case.) The service will be unpublished automatically when the
service object is garbage-collected.
@end deffn

@geindex bonjour;;check (function)
@anchor{pure-bonjour bonjour check}@anchor{8}
@deffn {Pure Function} bonjour::check service

Check for the result of a @pxref{7,,bonjour;;publish} operation. This blocks
until a result is available. A negative integer value indicates failure (in
this case the result is the Bonjour error code). Otherwise the result is a
triple with the actual service name, type and port. Note that the name may
be different from the one passed to @pxref{7,,bonjour;;publish} if there was a
name collision with another service. Such collisions are usually resolved
automatically by tacking on a suffix to the service name.
@end deffn

@node Discovering Services,Example,Publishing Services,Top
@anchor{pure-bonjour discovering-services}@anchor{9}
@chapter Discovering Services


These functions let you discover services of a given service type. For each
(resolvable) service you'll be able to retrieve the corresponding network
address and port, which is what you'll need to actually open a network
connection to communicate with the service.

@geindex bonjour;;browse (function)
@anchor{pure-bonjour bonjour browse}@anchor{a}
@deffn {Pure Function} bonjour::browse stype

Browse available services of a given type in the local domain. This
operation is carried out asynchronously; use @pxref{b,,bonjour;;avail} below to
check whether new information is available, and @pxref{c,,bonjour;;get} to
retrieve the actual service list. The result returned by
@pxref{a,,bonjour;;browse} is a pointer to the browser object which can be
passed to the following operations, or @code{NULL} in case of error. (A
@code{NULL} pointer can be passed safely to the other operations; they will
fail in this case.) Any resources allocated to the browser will be released
automatically when the browser object is garbage-collected.
@end deffn

@geindex bonjour;;avail (function)
@anchor{pure-bonjour bonjour avail}@anchor{b}
@deffn {Pure Function} bonjour::avail browser

Check whether the service information was updated since the last invocation
of @pxref{c,,bonjour;;get}. Returns an integer (truth value), which may also be
negative (indicating the Bonjour error code) in case of error.
@end deffn

@geindex bonjour;;get (function)
@anchor{pure-bonjour bonjour get}@anchor{c}
@deffn {Pure Function} bonjour::get browser

Retrieve the current list of services. Each list entry is a tuple with the
name, type, domain, IP address (all string values) and port number (an
integer) of a service. The entries are in the same order as returned by
Bonjour, but only include services whose network addresses can actually be
resolved using Bonjour. Note that this information may change over time, as
new services are announced on the network or removed from it. An
application will typically call @pxref{b,,bonjour;;avail} from time to time to
check whether new information is available and then retrieve the updated
service list using @pxref{c,,bonjour;;get}. The result may also be a negative
integer (indicating the Bonjour error code) in case of error.
@end deffn

@anchor{pure-bonjour example}@anchor{d}
@chapter Example


Here's an example showing how to publish an UDP OSC (Open Sound Control)
service which might be used to connect to mobile OSC applications such as
hexler's TouchOSC:

@example
using bonjour;
using namespace bonjour;

let s = publish "OSC Server" "_osc._udp" 8000;
check s;
@end example

@noindent

The last line checks for the result of the operation and returns the actual
service name, type and port number if all went well. A TouchOSC instance
running on the local network will then offer you to connect to the service.

Continuing the example, here's how you can obtain a list of OSC services
currently available on your local network:

@example
let t = browse "_osc._udp";
avail t;
get t;
@end example

@noindent

If you're running TouchOSC somewhere on your local network, it will be listed
there, along with our own service which we published above. The call in the
second line can be used to check whether any new information is available.
Applications typically invoke these two from time to time to update their
service list, using code like the following:

@example
avail t && get t;
@end example

@noindent
