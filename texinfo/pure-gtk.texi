Albert Graef <@email{aggraef@@gmail.com}>

pure-gtk is a collection of bindings to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit version 2.x
with Pure, see @indicateurl{http://www.gtk.org}. The bindings include the gtk (+gdk),
glib, atk, cairo and pango libraries, each in their own Pure module.

At present these are just straight 1-1 wrappers of the C libraries, created
with pure-gen. So they still lack some convenience, but they are perfectly
usable already, and a higher-level API for accessing all the functionality
will hopefully become available in time. In fact @emph{you} can help make that
happen. :) So please let me know if you'd like to give a helping hand in
improving pure-gtk.

@chapter Installation


You can get the latest source from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-gtk-0.13.tar.gz}.

For Windows users, a ready-made package in msi format is available from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-gtk-0.13.msi}.

To install from source, do the usual @code{make && sudo make install} (see the
Makefile for further options). This needs Pure and the GTK header files and
libraries. You'll also need @code{pure-ffi} for running the examples.

NOTE: The source release was prepared with GTK+ 2.24.4 on Ubuntu 11.04. If
you're seeing a lot of warnings and/or errors when compiling or loading the
modules, your GTK headers are probably much different from these. In that case
you should run @code{make generate} to regenerate the bindings; for this you also
need to have pure-gen installed. (If you already have pure-gen then it's a
good idea to do this anyway.)

See examples/hello.pure for a basic example. The files uiexample.pure and
uiexample.glade show how to run a GUI created with the Glade-3 interface
builder. This needs a recent version of the GtkBuilder API to work. (If you're
still running Glade-2 and an older GTK+ version, you might want to use the
older libglade interface instead. Support for that is in the Makefile, but
it's not enabled by default.) NOTE: The examples start up much faster when
they are compiled to native executables. To do this, just run @code{make
examples} after @code{make}. (Be patient, this takes a while.)
