Version 0.6, July 07, 2016

Albert Graef <@email{aggraef@@gmail.com}>

This is a digital audio interface for the Pure programming language. It
currently includes the following modules:


@itemize *

@item 
audio.pure: A PortAudio wrapper which gives you portable access to realtime
audio input and output on a variety of different host APIs. This uses the
well-known PortAudio library by Ross Bencina, Phil Burk et al, see
@indicateurl{http://www.portaudio.com/}.

@item 
fftw.pure: Compute real-valued FFTs of audio signals using Matteo Frigo's
and Steven G. Johnson's portable and fast FFTW library ("Fastest Fourier
Transform in the West").

@item 
sndfile.pure: Reading and writing audio files in various formats. This is a
fairly straightforward wrapper for Erik de Castro Lopo's libsndfile library,
see @indicateurl{http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/}.

@item 
samplerate.pure: Perform sample rate conversion on audio data. This uses
another of Erik's excellent libraries, libsamplerate (a.k.a. SRC), see
@indicateurl{http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/}.

@item 
realtime.pure: A little utility module which provides access to realtime
scheduling to Pure programs. You may need this for low-latency realtime
audio applications.
@end itemize

Documentation still needs to be written, so for the time being please read the
source modules listed above and have a look at the examples provided in the
distribution.

@chapter Installation


Get the latest source from
@indicateurl{https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-audio-0.6.tar.gz}.

You need to have libportaudio (v19), libsndfile (1.x), libsamplerate (0.1.x)
and libfftw3 (3.x) installed on your system. Any fairly recent version of
these libraries should do. For the realtime module you also need a POSIX
threads library (libpthread) with the POSIX realtime thread extension; Linux,
OSX and other Un*x systems should offer this.

The Pure wrappers contained in the distribution are for 64 bit POSIX
systems. If you're running a 32 bit system, or Windows, then you should
regenerate them using 'make generate'. This requires the header files
portaudio.h, samplerate.h and sndfile.h (and pure-gen, of course). If you do
this, check the includedir variables defined in the Makefiles, these need to
point to the directories where the corresponding header files are to be found
(the default is /usr/include).

Then just run 'make' to compile the package. If you're lucky and everything
compiles smoothly, you can install with 'sudo make install'.

If you're not so lucky, you can get help on the Pure mailing list, see
@indicateurl{http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang}.
